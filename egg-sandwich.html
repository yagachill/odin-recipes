    <h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>
    
    <p>A dad came up with this recipe years ago. Over the years, everyone I have shared this with always reacts the same way.</p> 
    <p>First, they tell me 'that sounds awful!' After they eat it their story changes to 'that was amazing!'</p>
    <p>I know the idea of mayo and mustard on a scrambled egg disk sounds odd, but trust me; you'll love it.</p>
    <p>I know the cooking method for the eggs may be sacrilege for some folks; I just ask that you try it before changing it up."</p>

    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2 slices bread, toasted</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon prepared yellow mustard</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Beat eggs, milk, and salt together in a bowl.</p>

    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Heat a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook eggs in hot skillet without</p>
    <p>stirring until set on the bottom, about 1 1/2 minutes. Flip eggs and cook without</p>
    <p>stirring until set on the other side, about 1 minute more. Remove from heat.</p>

    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Spread 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise on each piece of toast. Spread mustard over</p>
    <p>mayonnaise onto each piece of toast. Place eggs on one piece of toast and top with</p>
    <p>remaining toast.</p>
